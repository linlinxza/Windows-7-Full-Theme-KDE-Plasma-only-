# Windows-7-Full-Theme-KDE-Plasma-only-
Here it is. A Full Windows 7 theme! (Possibly)

Tested with KDE 5.18

Just copy these lines:

git clone https://github.com/linlinxza/Windows-7-Full-Theme-KDE-Plasma-only-

./transformationsetup.sh

It will copy everything to the specified system directories required to make this theme work.
Then it will ask whether or not to copy over your user config files in the current user profile. 
(Your current desktop settings will be overwritten!)
Type "Y" for yes. Or otherwise, the script will just skip it if any other character is entered.

Then for the splash screen, select the option for "7" as your plymouth boot screen.
